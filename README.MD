This project is for learning more how to manipulate the stack data type.

I have been completing challenges from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/ and each of these challenges
are listed on separate branches (for the most part!).

I've also included some pytest scripts in order to practice using this tool.

The following is present:
1. Implementation of stack data structure in Python
2. Reversing a stack
3. Reversing a stack using recursion
4. Reversing individual words in a sentence
5. Finding the maximum difference between nearest left and right smaller elements using stack
