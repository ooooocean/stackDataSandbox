This project is for learning more how to manipulate the stack data type.

I have been completing challenges from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/ and each of these challenges
are listed on separate branches (for the most part!).

I've also included some pytest scripts in order to practice using this tool.
